# Gymshark Customer Service Agent with Mastra AI

## ðŸš€ Quickstart

This example demonstrates how to use GOAT to build a Shopify store customer service agent with [Mastra](https://github.com/mastra-ai/mastra) that can:

1. Receive and respond to SMS messages via [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/)
2. Search for products in the Gymshark Shopify store based on customer queries using [Rye's API](https://docs.rye.com/)
3. Provide product recommendations and customer service assistance

You can use this example with any other agent framework, chain, and wallet of your choice.

## Setup

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/goat-sdk/goat.git && cd goat
```

2. Run the following commands from the `typescript` directory:
```bash
cd typescript
pnpm install
pnpm build
```

3. Go to the example directory:
```bash
cd examples/by-framework/mastra-commerce-agent
```

4. Copy the `.env.template` and populate with your values:
```bash
cp .env.template .env
```

Required environment variables:
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key for the LLM
- `WALLET_PRIVATE_KEY`: Your wallet private key for Base Sepolia
- `RPC_PROVIDER_URL`: RPC URL for Base Sepolia (e.g., from Alchemy)
- `CROSSMINT_API_KEY`: Your Crossmint API key
- `TWILIO_ACCOUNT_SID`: Your Twilio account SID
- `TWILIO_AUTH_TOKEN`: Your Twilio auth token
- `TWILIO_PHONE_NUMBER`: Your Twilio phone number
- `RYE_API_KEY`: Your Rye API key for Shopify store search

5. Add some test funds to your wallet by going to any [Base Sepolia Faucet](https://www.alchemy.com/faucets/base-sepolia)

## Usage

### CLI Mode

1. Run the interactive CLI:
```bash
pnpm tsx src/index.ts
```

2. Chat with the agent:
- Type `twilio` to start the Twilio SMS server
- Ask questions like "I'm looking for men's workout shirts" or "Do you have any women's leggings?"
- The agent will search the Gymshark store and recommend products

### Twilio SMS Server

1. Start the Twilio SMS server directly:
```bash
pnpm twilio-server
```

2. Use ngrok to expose your local server:
```bash
ngrok http 3000
```

3. Configure your Twilio phone number's webhook:
   - Go to the Twilio console
   - Set the webhook URL for SMS to your ngrok URL + "/sms" (e.g., https://abc123.ngrok.io/sms)
   - Set the HTTP method to POST

4. Send an SMS to your Twilio phone number to start interacting with the agent

## Key Features

### Gymshark Product Search

The agent uses Rye's API to search for products in the Gymshark Shopify store. This allows customers to find products based on:
- Product type (shirts, leggings, shorts, etc.)
- Gender (men's, women's)
- Size
- Color
- Activity type (running, training, yoga, etc.)

### Natural Language Understanding

Powered by the Mastra AI framework, the agent can understand complex queries and provide personalized recommendations based on customer needs.

### SMS Communication

The agent communicates with customers via SMS using Twilio's messaging API, making it accessible to anyone with a mobile phone.

## Using in Production

In production, developers require advanced wallet setups that utilize [smart wallets](https://docs.goat-sdk.com/concepts/smart-wallets), which allow them to:
1. **Increase security** by setting programmable permissions
2. **Maintain regulatory compliance** by ensuring agent wallets are non-custodial

For more information on production deployments, please refer to the [GOAT SDK documentation](https://docs.goat-sdk.com/).
